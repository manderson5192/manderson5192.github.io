      <description>&lt;p&gt;My name is Matt Anderson and I&amp;rsquo;m an Engineering Manager at &lt;a href=&#34;https://expanse.co&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Expanse&lt;/a&gt;, a cybersecurity startup that is indexing the entire global internet to defend some of the world&amp;rsquo;s most important organizations.  I focus on systems that mine big and streaming datasets, and I take a particular interest in the security, privacy, and openness of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of work, I enjoy exploring the mountains, rivers, lakes, deserts, and coastline of the Western United States, as well as the small towns that lie between them.  During the summer of 2015, I hiked more than 1,000 miles southbound along the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), and have increased my PCT mileage to 1,330 in the summers since.  I&amp;rsquo;ve visited every National Park in Washington, Oregon, and California, and am constantly in search of the next beautiful place to visit.&lt;/p&gt;
